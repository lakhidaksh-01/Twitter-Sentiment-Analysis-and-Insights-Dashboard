# About the dataset:

The dataset contains over 14,000 tweets collected over a 7-day period related to major US airlines. It’s sourced from Twitter and includes the tweet text, timestamp, airline mentioned, hashtags, and sentiment labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral).

# How I Cleaned the Data:

1. Removed extra columns – I deleted columns like IDs, usernames, and gold labels that were not useful.

2. Cleaned the tweets – I removed:

 - @mentions

 - links (like https://…)

 - emojis

 - special characters (#, &, etc.)

 - stopwords (like “the”, “is”, “at”)

3. Made text consistent – I converted all text to lowercase.

4. Created new columns – I added word count, character length, hashtag count, and emoji count for each tweet.

5. Kept what matters – I kept the sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral) because they are the target for my analysis in Power BI.



# About the Project:

I built a professional Twitter sentiment analysis dashboard end-to-end, turning messy social data into clear insights to help businesses understand public opinion and make data-driven decisions.
